  'About Me': `Growing up in Southern California, I have walked many paths and aquired many hobbies.
    Always up for trying new things, many many many MANY years ago I found a love for technology. Around the age of 7 or 8, some placed a Nintendo GameCube controller in my hand and booted up Metroid Prime and I was hooked.
    Fast-forwarding many years I had established an identity with technology, building my own PC and fixing basic appliances. I truly can not see a future without these keystones in my life.`,

  'Experience': `Beginning my Software enginneering journey at College of the Canyons, I spent around 2-3 years working a full time job while squeezing classes in when I could.
    The extremely slow pace at which I was progressing in school, paired with the Covid-19 Pandemic that basically shut me out of a year of my school career, lead me to putting my bachelors on hold and enrolling in Hack Reactor.
    This gave me sufficient experience using Javascript to be qualified as a FullStack engineer.
    I have been a Project Manager for a team of 8 software engineers, creating an end to end phone application in React native.
    Along with this, I have had multiple key roles developing the front and back of various mock E-commerce sites.`
